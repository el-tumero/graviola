                        <p>
                            We stumbled upon ORA.io just before the hackathon started and were blown away by the capability to run <a href="https://docs.ora.io/doc/technology/opml" className="text-blue-600 underline">Stable Diffusion 2 and LLaMA 2 (7B)</a> on Ethereum.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We all dig <a href="https://cryptopunks.app/" className="text-blue-600 underline">CryptoPunks</a>, but there's a hitch: they're too cookie-cutter and similar. We decided to take it up a notch by creating something far more unpredictable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Graviola is a dynamically generated NFT collection powered by the generative AI model (SD2). This setup, based on a dynamic collection of keywords and artificial intelligence, adds an element of surprise, as the outcome is unpredictable â€” even to us. This contrasts with NFTs that are pre-designed before minting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The randomness of Graviola is its biggest draw â€” the rarity of our images is based on probability. We also allow trading three images for one completely new one, increasing the likelihood of obtaining a rarer image during this exchange.

                            Winning the Bounty is just the beginning. We believe this project has potential and is worth developing further. Weâ€™ve set several goals for advancing our app:

                            <li>Introduce ERC20 Graviola Token and Tokenomics.</li>
                            <li>Build a community and social media presence for users.</li>
                            <li>Decentralize the protocol through a DAO â€” allowing users to define the direction Graviola takes (We plan to introduce seasonal, limited keywords and expanding the metadata.)</li>
                            <li>Improve UX.</li>
                            <li>Launch on the mainnet.</li>
