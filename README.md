# Graviola
Project for [Autonomous Agent: AI x Web3 Hackathon 2024](https://autonomous-agent.devpost.com/) (ORA Bounty 2 Winner)

## About
Graviola's initiative employs blockchain, AI, and randomness to autonomously produce NFTs using user-supplied and on-chain stored keywords. It processes these keywords into AI-generated portraits through Stable Diffusion, then catalogs these unique NFTs with associated rarity and other metadata attributes on the blockchain.
